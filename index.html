				<h1>Scratch Dictionary</h1>
				<p class="indent">
					For some reason, I’ve found it really difficult to find a repository of scratch techniques on the internet. &nbsp;Every now and then I’ll come across a discussion about a particular one and someone will take a picture of a hand drawn diagram of said scratch, but what if you don’t have time to dig through <a target="_blank" href="http://djbattles.com/">dead turntablist forums</a> or half complete technique repositories? &nbsp;Well I hope I can help. &nbsp;Currently I have a giant whiteboard of scratches for my personal reference but that doesn’t help anybody else, and that’s what this site is about – DJs helping DJs.
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					If you don’t understand the diagrams, please refer to the TTM section below. &nbsp;In an ideal world this page will be updated as often as I have free time (and until I run out of scratches to transcribe).  Lastly, apologies for the inconsistencies in the diagrams, perfection takes time.  If you want to drop comments, hit up the contact page.&nbsp;Enjoy.

					<h1>TTM</h1>
					<p class="indent">TTM or <em>Turntablist Transcription Method</em> was invented by <a href="http://www.ttmethod.com" target="_blank">John Carluccio</a> as a way to write music tablature for DJs. &nbsp;It works by graphing record movement along the vertical axis against time along the horizontal axis. &nbsp;The line is used to draw out the dynamic record motion. &nbsp;The blank space in the notation is where the crossfader is “closed”, or muting the record that’s playing. &nbsp;Small dots in the notation stand for “clicks” where the crossfader is momentarily closed. &nbsp;The grid can be used to place the scratches against standard musical phrasing, but I don’t like to get that particular. &nbsp;In fact, I don’t think this should be used to break down any scratch routine into gruesome detail. &nbsp;I use it as a tool to learn particular scratches and then to learn them as combos. &nbsp;I hope these will serve as a reference tool that you can use to better understand more complicated scratch patterns.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">The basic idea of the tablature is shown below.  The sample (‘freshh’) on the far left is at an angle meant to represent it playing at normal speed, while the varying angles, breaks and directions of the samples on the rest of the staff are meant to represent changes to the playback of the sound.</p>

<p>		<span class="description">Start with the fader open, and as you push the record forward, close the fader, next open the fader and pull your hand back to the starting position.  If you cut regular then your hands should move synchronously, with your record hand moving forward and fader and moving outward.  If you cut hamster, your hands with move synchronously opposite, record hand moving forward and fader hand going inward.  If you take a high pitched sound and do this scratch fairly fast, you get what sounds like chirping birds.  This is also responsible for the ‘wicka wicka’ sound.</span>

<div id="flares">
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Flare Technique</span><p></p>
<p>This technique, invented in the 90s by DJ flare, requires you to move your record and fader hand out of sync to obtain more sounds per motion. It involves moving the record while momentarily closing the fader, giving you an pause. This momentary closing of the fader is referred to as a ‘click’ (I’m going to postulate that’s because of the noise it makes when it hits the end of it’s throw). Flaring is a fundamentally different way to scratch that opened up the door for a lot more advanced techniques that were invented later.

<div id="flaresandorbits">
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Flares and Orbits</span><p></p>
<p>All too often these scratches are named and discussed separately, but they are completely one and the same. ‘Flares’ refer to the technique of clicking the fader closed during the record motion, while ‘orbits’ refer to the process of performing a scratch and then doing it in reverse, thus returning to your starting point. The ’2 click orbit’ for instance is just a slightly more compact way to say the ’2 click flare orbit’, which is shorter still than writing ‘ 2 click flare forward, 2 click flare reverse’.

			I think of this scratch in two parts.  For the first half, start with the fader open, move the record forward and tap the fader closed TWICE, ending closed.  For the second half, just open the fader and pull the record back.  You should be turning a baby scratch into three sounds, something like “Ahh – hh – hhhhA’ if that makes any sense.  You can also apply the same fader motion to a back-forward baby and you’ll get a reverse OG flare.<br>

			Same as the 2 click technique but with an extra click.  This will split one sound into 4 with the use of 3 pauses.  This scratch can be done by pinching the wrist to get the successive clicks, but as the tempo of the scratch increases it’s generally easier to use a ‘crabbing’ technique with 3 fingers.  For me, wrist pinching is more precise but crabbing is faster, find a balance my friends!<br>

			This scratch is the same as a 1 click orbit, but with an added click in the middle.  During a 1 click orbit you get a pause when you change direction, with the crescent flare you get the same thing but you clean up the sound quite a bit.  The end result should be 4 sharply chopped sounds.  As Qbert described in his How To volume 1, this is called the crescent flare because it comes back around like a moon shape.  Don’t worry, I don’t know what that means either.<br>

<p>I think ‘Delayed 2 click flare’ is a more instructive name for this scratch, but some people would argue that name is reserved for an entirely different scratch.  Either way, Boomerang seems to be the accepted terminology.  This scratch is a 2 click orbit technique with the fader and record hands slightly off timed.  It also repeats after 6 sounds, so unless you’re cutting to 3/4 timed jazz standards (dope!), could say this is doubly-off timed.  What you end up with is a dicing pattern that sounds super duper fresh.</p>
<p>I like to think of this scratch in terms of 2 halves (each Forward-Back-Forward).  The first half starts with the fader closed, next open it, do a baby and close it, then follow it with a forward stab.  The next three notes are made by doing the first half of the pattern in reverse.  This scratch is weird at first, but once you get it you realize it’s just an off timed 2 click and you’ll be glad you spend all those long hours learning how do do 2 clicks (which you did right??)</p>

			Once you do this scratch at a fairly good tempo you’ll realize that this another 3 click technique – so get your wrist ready.  I find this scratch fairly simple, hopefully the instructions will be also.  Start with the fader closed, open it and do a baby, then close it.  Then dice a baby scratch into two sounds, closing the fader on the direction change and ending closed.  Now you’re back where you started and ready to begin again.  The end result should be 4, and if you played it with your mouth would sound something like “Ahhwaahh Ahh Ahh”.  I chose not to put this in with the other flare scratches because it isn’t really a flare technique, if you look at the diagram you’ll see that any fader clicks happen on direction changes, not in the middle of a record motion.<br>

<h3 class="title">Autobahns</h3>
<p>		<span class="description"></span></p>
<p>This is a relatively new technique, popularized (invented?) by DJ Rafik.  It is a combination of a 2 click and a 3 part tear.  It’s easier to follow the diagram than to read it in words but I’ll do my best.  I think of this scratch in three parts:</p>
<ol><em>1.</em>  Open the fader, do a baby scratch, then close the fader, then do a forward stab</ol>
<ol><em>2.</em>  This is your new starting position, half way into the sample.  Do the same scratch as described in the first step and end a little further into the sample.</ol>
<ol><em>3.</em>  Open the fader, do a baby scratch, close the fader, then do a reverse stab.  You should be back at your starting position</ol>
<p></p>
<p>			You might not notice Rafik doing them in his routines, but that’s probably because he does them so fast.  He also uses a twiddle technique to get ridiculously fast 2 clicks.  Must be the reason he finds this scratch “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tg-RDaJs2c" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">very easy</a>“!<br>

<p>People starting talking about this scratch due to some videos of Rafik or somebody on Qbert’s Scratchlopedia video trying to show Autobahns and doing different techniques unintentionally (I guess?).  This is a similar to the regular autobahn except that its made of 8 sounds so that it fits neatly into one bar and it’s a palindrome scratch (if you learn the first half, do the second half in reverse!).  I’ll split the scratch into 3, 3 and 2 sounds for the explanation</p>
<ol><em>1.</em>Start with the fader closed, open it, do a baby and close the fader, follow it with a forward stab.  End with the fader closed and half way into the sample.</ol>
<ol><em>2.</em>Repeat the first step, ending even further into the sample</ol>
<ol><em>3.</em>Pull back the record and do a 1 click and end with the fader closed.  This last step could be seen as half of a reverse OG Flare.</ol>
<p>Once you get the flow of this scratch, you’ll see how the two click technique fits in and this is kind of just a half assed autobahn.</p>
